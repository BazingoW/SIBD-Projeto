With some contributions from me and [@Jose-Miragaia ](https://github.com/Jose-Miragaia)


The objective of this project was to understand how to implement the backend (php) and the database (Mysql) of a normal application.
In this case it is an interface for a doctor to manage patients, such as adding new patients, assigning them with medical devices, and annotate images related to those patients.
